The main office is in\n                        Seattle. The branch offices are in Toronto, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, and\n                        Vancouver.Contoso has a subsidiary named Fabrikam, Ltd. that has offices in New York and San\n                        Francisco.Existing Environment -End-User Environment -All users at Contoso use Windows 10\n                        devices. Each user is licensed for Microsoft 365. In addition, iOS devices are distributed\n                        to the members of the sales team at Contoso.Cloud and Hybrid Infrastructure -All Contoso\n                        applications are deployed to Azure.You enable Microsoft Cloud App Security.Contoso and\n                        Fabrikam have different Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. Fabrikam recently\n                        purchased an Azure subscription and enabled Azure Defender for all supported resource\n                        types.Current Problems -The security team at Contoso receives a large number of\n                        cybersecurity alerts. The security team spends too much time identifying which cybersecurity\n                        alerts are legitimate threats, and which are not.The Contoso sales team uses only iOS\n                        devices. The sales team members exchange files with customers by using a variety of\n                        third-party tools. In the past, the sales team experienced phishing attacks on their\n                        devices.The marketing team at Contoso has several Microsoft SharePoint Online sites for\n                        collaborating with external vendors. The marketing team has had several incidents in which\n                        vendors uploaded files that contain malware.The executive team at Contoso suspects a\n                        security breach. The executive team requests that you identify which files had more than\n                        five activities during the past48 hours, including data access, download, or deletion for\n                        Microsoft Cloud App Security-protected applications.Requirements -Planned Changes -Contoso\n                        plans to integrate the security operations of both companies and manage all security\n                        operations centrally.Technical Requirements -Contoso identifies the following technical\n                        requirements: Receive alerts if an Azure virtual machine is under brute force attack. Use\n                        Azure Sentinel to reduce organizational risk by rapidly remediating active attacks on the\n                        environment. Implement Azure Sentinel queries that correlate data across the Azure AD\n                        tenants of Contoso and Fabrikam. Develop a procedure to remediate Azure Defender for Key\n                        Vault alerts for Fabrikam in case of external attackers and a potential compromise of its\n                        own AzureAD applications.

Each user is licensed for Microsoft 365. In addition, iOS devices are distributed\n                        to the members of the sales team at Contoso.Cloud and Hybrid Infrastructure -All Contoso\n                        applications are deployed to Azure.You enable Microsoft Cloud App Security.Contoso and\n                        Fabrikam have different Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. Fabrikam recently\n                        purchased an Azure subscription and enabled Azure Defender for all supported resource\n                        types.Current Problems -The security team at Contoso receives a large number of\n                        cybersecurity alerts. The security team spends too much time identifying which cybersecurity\n                        alerts are legitimate threats, and which are not.The Contoso sales team uses only iOS\n                        devices. The sales team members exchange files with customers by using a variety of\n                        third-party tools. In the past, the sales team experienced phishing attacks on their\n                        devices.The marketing team at Contoso has several Microsoft SharePoint Online sites for\n                        collaborating with external vendors. The marketing team has had several incidents in which\n                        vendors uploaded files that contain malware.The executive team at Contoso suspects a\n                        security breach. The executive team requests that you identify which files had more than\n                        five activities during the past48 hours, including data access, download, or deletion for\n                        Microsoft Cloud App Security-protected applications.Requirements -Planned Changes -Contoso\n                        plans to integrate the security operations of both companies and manage all security\n                        operations centrally.Technical Requirements -Contoso identifies the following technical\n                        requirements: Receive alerts if an Azure virtual machine is under brute force attack. Use\n                        Azure Sentinel to reduce organizational risk by rapidly remediating active attacks on the\n                        environment. Implement Azure Sentinel queries that correlate data across the Azure AD\n                        tenants of Contoso and Fabrikam. Develop a procedure to remediate Azure Defender for Key\n                        Vault alerts for Fabrikam in case of external attackers and a potential compromise of its\n                        own AzureAD applications.

The main office is in\n                        Seattle. The branch offices are in Toronto, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, and\n                        Vancouver.Contoso has a subsidiary named Fabrikam, Ltd. that has offices in New York and San\n                        Francisco.Existing Environment -End-User Environment -All users at Contoso use Windows 10\n                        devices. Each user is licensed for Microsoft 365. In addition, iOS devices are distributed\n                        to the members of the sales team at Contoso.Cloud and Hybrid Infrastructure -All Contoso\n                        applications are deployed to Azure.You enable Microsoft Cloud App Security.Contoso and\n                        Fabrikam have different Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants. Fabrikam recently\n                        purchased an Azure subscription and enabled Azure Defender for all supported resource\n                        types.Current Problems -The security team at Contoso receives a large number of\n                        cybersecurity alerts. The security team spends too much time identifying which cybersecurity\n                        alerts are legitimate threats, and which are not.The Contoso sales team uses only iOS\n                        devices. The sales team members exchange files with customers by using a variety of\n                        third-party tools. In the past, the sales team experienced phishing attacks on their\n                        devices.The marketing team at Contoso has several Microsoft SharePoint Online sites for\n                        collaborating with external vendors. The marketing team has had several incidents in which\n                        vendors uploaded files that contain malware.The executive team at Contoso suspects a\n                        security breach. The executive team requests that you identify which files had more than\n                        five activities during the past48 hours, including data access, download, or deletion for\n                        Microsoft Cloud App Security-protected applications.Requirements -Planned Changes -Contoso\n                        plans to integrate the security operations of both companies and manage all security\n                        operations centrally.Technical Requirements -Contoso identifies the following technical\n                        requirements: Receive alerts if an Azure virtual machine is under brute force attack. Use\n                        Azure Sentinel to reduce organizational risk by rapidly remediating active attacks on the\n                        environment.
